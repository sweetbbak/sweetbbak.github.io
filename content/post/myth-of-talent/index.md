The myth of talent and the lies we tell ourselves that restrict our potential

<!--more-->

@sweetbabyalaska
I don't think that there isn't a skill variation, I just think people who suck at something justify that by throwing around this magical idea of "talent" - sure it does exist but most people use this as an excuse as to why they aren't as good as someone else but they completely ignore the amount of work and effort that person has put in. No one is born being good at something, they may have some predisposition to the subject but that is not the end all, be all that modern society makes it out to be. People are far more often using the excuse of talent to underplay the work some people do and to justify why they suck ass because they arent putting in that work. People put way to much weight on "talent"
just a small example is people would tell me that Im talented when it comes to drawing, but what those people didnt see was the thousands of hours I put in autistically studying lightingn, figures and forms... and the literal thousands of hours of raw practice. I wasn't born being good at it, I sucked ass at first, but people will literally say "you are talented, there is no way I could ever do that" which is a lie we all tell ourselves and I think that is far more damaging to our own potential.

outline:

- there is a spectrum of skill
- there is predisposition to being good at something

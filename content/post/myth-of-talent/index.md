The myth of talent and the lies we tell ourselves that restrict our potential

<!--more-->

@sweetbabyalaska
I don't think that there isn't a skill variation, I just think people who suck at something justify that by throwing around this magical idea of "talent" - sure it does exist but most people use this as an excuse as to why they aren't as good as someone else but they completely ignore the amount of work and effort that person has put in. No one is born being good at something, they may have some predisposition to the subject but that is not the end all, be all that modern society makes it out to be. People are far more often using the excuse of talent to underplay the work some people do and to justify why they suck ass because they arent putting in that work. People put way to much weight on "talent"
just a small example is people would tell me that Im talented when it comes to drawing, but what those people didnt see was the thousands of hours I put in autistically studying lightingn, figures and forms... and the literal thousands of hours of raw practice. I wasn't born being good at it, I sucked ass at first, but people will literally say "you are talented, there is no way I could ever do that" which is a lie we all tell ourselves and I think that is far more damaging to our own potential.

outline:

- there is a spectrum of skill
- there is predisposition to being good at something

# Talent

I do find it baffling the mythos that surrounds "talent" and "meritocracy" in the Western world. I subscribe to the idea that so-called "geniuses" are made and not born.
Obviously there are factors into this, like success early on, and a variety of factors that may influence your predisposition to doing a certain thing well.

But, at the same time, I know for a fact that far too many people put way too much weight on "talent" and often tell themselves that they can't do something.
Someone may see you do something (like drawing or playing music) and say "wow, you are talented, I could never do that" but what you didn't see was how awful
they were when they started and the thousands of hours they put into studying light and practicing constructing form from abstract shapes.

I think that this is a dangerous lie. You, in fact, could get good at drawing... and you could overcome any blocks to that if you put in the effort and work.
You just don't want to or are not following through. Some people will naturally be better, sure, but that is no excuse to say you are incapable of doing something.
I almost find that notion insulting.

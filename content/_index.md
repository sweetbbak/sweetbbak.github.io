Welcome! I'm sweetbbak. I'm a self-taught programmer and Linux enthusiast. I really enjoy learning about how programming languages work.
I am fairly skilled with `Bash`, and `Golang`... and I'm currently learning `Rust`, `C`, `Nix` and `Zig`. I am also currently working on
writing my own language and shell.

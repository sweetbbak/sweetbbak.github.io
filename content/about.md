Hi! I'm sweetbbak. [sweetbbak](https://github.com/sweetbbak)

I am a self-taught programmer who loves learning about computing concepts. I am currently most interested in:

- Unix domain programming
- Low level systems
- Command line utilities
- creating tools that are fun, interesting and unique
- image manipulation and color algorithms
- text to speech systems
- creating pipelines that scrape novels, turn them into audiobooks and encode them with an image as a video for youtube
- terminal graphics
- learning Linux by creating projects for Unix systems (ie: a display manager, sudo/doas, init system, coreutils etc...)

Everything that I write is free and open-source. I currently use NixOS. My favorite interactive shell is ZSH and my favorite terminal is Kitty.
I use Wayland + Hyprland (and River and Sway).
